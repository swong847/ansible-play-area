# NOTE this playbook changes the root password on DRAC v5+ (will probably not work on v4).  You must pass in the value via -e "root_password=newpassword" where "newpassword" is the new password to use.  Also this playbook is configured to print the output by default regardless of success.  It's recommended that this be left in place to catch unhandled issues.
